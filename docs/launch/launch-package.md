# Hi Meet AI — v1 Launch Package

**What the customer sees on day 1.**

This document is the definitive list of user-visible surfaces at launch. It diffs against the actual application state in each cycle's end-of-cycle integration review. If this doc and the app disagree, this doc wins and the app is corrected.

## Visible nav items (in SidebarNav order)

```
Primary
├── Today              → /today
├── Campaign Plans     → /campaigns       (✓ Cycle 2: renamed in UI)
├── Prospects          → /prospects       (✓ Cycle 2: header "Lead Pipeline" → "Prospects")

Operations (single item when other operations are hidden)
└── Run Analysis       → /

Bottom
├── Why Us             → /why-us
└── Settings           → /settings         (✓ Cycle 2: API keys + Danger Zone hidden)
```

**6 nav items.** Everything else is hidden.

## Visible pages

| Route | Page | Launch status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| `/login` | LoginPage | Launch | Public |
| `/register` | RegisterPage | Launch | Public |
| `/` | Dashboard (teaser + analysis flow) | Launch | OnboardingModal + AgentNetwork + ConversationPanel + ResultsPanel |
| `/today` | TodayPage | Launch | Post-login landing; 3 sections (benchmarks, prospects, signals preview) |
| `/campaigns` | CampaignsPage | Launch (as "Campaign Plans") | Planning posture; no Activate CTAs |
| `/prospects` | LeadsPipeline | Launch | Kanban view; no Enroll CTA |
| `/settings` | SettingsPage | Launch (stripped) | Profile + display prefs only |
| `/why-us` | WhyUsPage | Launch | Static |
| `/leads` | (redirects) | — | 301 → `/prospects` |

**11 routes, 8 pages (plus 1 alias redirect).**

## Hidden pages (code exists, routes guarded)

| Route | Gate flag | Cycle where it becomes visible (if ever) |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `/content` | `contentBeta` | Cycle 3 QA gate; otherwise stays hidden |
| `/insights` | `signalsFeed` | v1.1 |
| `/signals` | `signalsFeed` | v1.1 |
| `/results` | `attributionResults` | When outreach has data |
| `/approvals` | `approvals` | Advisory-only, never public |
| `/sequences` | `sequences` | Advisory-only, never public |
| `/playbooks` | `playbooks` | v1.1 |
| `/workforce` | `workforce` | v1.2+ |
| `/dashboard` | `dashboardOps` | Internal only, never public |
| `/agent/market-intelligence` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/campaign-architect` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/lead-hunter` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/gtm-strategist` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/competitor-analyst` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/customer-profiler` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/company-enricher` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |
| `/agent/:agentId` | `agentWorkspaces` | v1.2+ |

**17 hidden routes.** All redirect to `/today` via `FeatureGate` in production builds.

## Promise-scope audit

Visibility scope (this document) tracks WHAT users see. Promise scope tracks WHAT they're led to believe the product does. The two scopes are tracked separately because they can drift independently.

See **[`promise-scope-audit.md`](./promise-scope-audit.md)** for the per-surface promise audit. Updated in each cycle's red-team.

**Rule**: a launch surface can be visible only if its visibility scope AND its promise scope both match the actual product behavior.

## Customer capabilities at launch

What a v1 customer can do, end-to-end:

1. **Register** with email + company name
2. **Log in** (30-min access token with refresh)
3. **Run an analysis**: upload a document or paste a URL, answer onboarding questions, watch the 6 AI specialists work in real time
4. **See results**: executive summary, prospects with fit scores, competitor intelligence, market trends, campaign ideas, full report export
5. **Check daily briefing** (`/today`): vertical benchmarks, recent prospects, live signals preview
6. **Manage prospects** (`/prospects`): Kanban workflow — New → Qualified → Contacted → Won/Lost; manual status transitions only
7. **Plan campaigns** (`/campaigns`): create campaign drafts from analysis insights; no execution
8. **Export** the full GTM report as JSON

What a v1 customer **cannot** do:

- ❌ Send outreach emails (execution layer hidden)
- ❌ Enroll leads in sequences (execution layer hidden)
- ❌ See attribution / ROI dashboards (no data yet)
- ❌ Sync to HubSpot or other CRMs (integration hidden)
- ❌ Access individual agent workspaces (power-user feature hidden)
- ❌ Activate playbooks (browse-only, and even browse is hidden at v1)

## Launch story

See `docs/launch/naming-conventions.md` for the canonical customer-facing message.

## Diff check protocol

At the end of every cycle, run this diff:

1. **Nav items** — `services/dashboard/src/components/SidebarNav.tsx` should list exactly the 6 items above. If it lists more, either (a) add them here and justify, or (b) remove them from SidebarNav.
2. **Routes** — `services/dashboard/src/App.tsx` should have: unguarded routes for the 11 above + `<FeatureGate>`-wrapped routes for the 17 hidden ones. Any unguarded hidden route is a regression.
3. **CTAs** — grep `services/dashboard/src/pages/` for button labels matching: "Activate", "Send", "Enroll", "Launch Campaign", "Design Workforce". Each hit must be either removed or gated.
4. **Story match** — user-visible copy (page titles, empty states, marketing headers) should not contradict the canonical launch story.

Cycle end is not complete until this diff is clean.
